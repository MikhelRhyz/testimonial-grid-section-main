                                        to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
                                        here. I
                                        signed
                                        up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                                        thereafter.
                                        The
                                        next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since

                            <p class="card-text Light-grayish-blue">Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
                                needed
                                some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was
                                encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                                about
                                the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
                                and
                                I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                                outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
                                have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                                development
                                experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                                multiple offers. 100% recommend!</p>
